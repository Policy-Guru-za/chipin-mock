## Dogfood Evidence

- Live voucher-row dogfood was intentionally not repeated because specs 48-49 already removed the last known voucher boards/payouts from the main DB. Fallback dogfood exercised the close route, payout API, and host dashboard compatibility surfaces through `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/payout-service-create.test.ts tests/integration/api-dream-boards-close.test.ts tests/integration/api-payouts-voucher.test.ts tests/unit/host-dashboard-view-model.test.ts tests/integration/dashboard-host-flow.test.tsx`, proving unsupported voucher closes now fail before state mutation, public payout responses hide voucher rows, and dashboard rendering uses explicit `Takealot Voucher` labeling instead of Karri copy.

## Napkin Evidence

Updated [`docs/napkin/napkin.md`](./docs/napkin/napkin.md) with the legacy-compatibility reminder to keep raw read-model strings plus allowlist filtering/explicit labels after narrowing active enums.
