# ChipIn Technical Documentation

> **Version:** 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated:** January 28, 2026  
> **Status:** Ready for Development

## Quick Start for AI Coding Agents

**Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) first.** It contains:
- Build order and phased implementation
- Code standards and patterns
- Key implementation details
- File structure requirements
- Frontend aesthetics guidelines (NO "AI slop")

## What We're Building

**ChipIn** is a social gifting platform where:
1. Parent creates a "Dream Board" with ONE gift item from Takealot
2. Shares link with party guests via WhatsApp
3. Guests contribute money toward the gift
4. When pot closes, funds convert to a Takealot gift card

**Tagline:** *Friends chip in together to turn birthday clutter into one dream gift.*

## MVP Scope

### In Scope
- ✅ Dream Board creation with Takealot URL
- ✅ Philanthropy-only Dream Boards (primary charity goal)
- ✅ Magic link authentication
- ✅ Guest contribution via PayFast, Ozow (EFT), SnapScan (QR)
- ✅ Optional payout method: Fund my Karri Card
- ✅ Charity overflow selection (used when gift is fully funded)
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Email notifications
- ✅ Takealot gift card or Karri top-up payout (manual process OK)
- ✅ Public Partner API (API keys, scopes, rate limiting)

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)
- ❌ Karri Card API automation (manual top-up OK for MVP)
- ❌ Native mobile apps

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **One gift, not a registry** — Simplicity over flexibility
2. **Mobile web, not native app** — Zero download friction for guests
3. **Takealot-first** — Karri is optional, not a dependency
4. **We expose APIs** — Partners integrate with us, not reverse
5. **Manual payout OK for MVP** — Automation can come later
6. **No "AI slop" UI** — Distinctive, opinionated design

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo>
cd chipin
pnpm install

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in environment variables

# 3. Set up database
pnpm drizzle:generate
pnpm drizzle:push

# 4. Run development server
pnpm dev
```

## Useful Commands

# Lint / types / tests
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test

# Load testing
pnpm test:load
```

## Questions?

If requirements are unclear:
1. Check the specific document
2. Follow the principle of simplicity
3. When in doubt, implement the minimal version

**Goal:** Working MVP, not perfect system. Ship, then iterate.
